# Product Discount Calculator (Practice)

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains my solution attempt for a C language exercise ("Micro Intero"). 
The program is designed to handle product inputs, categorize them, and calculate the final price based on specific discount rules.

## 🛠️ Concepts Applied
I used this project to practice the following C language fundamentals:
* **Switch Statements:** To handle different category options (A, B, C).
* **For Loops:** To iterate through the number of products.
* **If-Else Logic:** To calculate mathematical discounts.
* **Input/Output:** Using `scanf` and `printf`.

## ⚙️ How the Code Works
1.  The user inputs the **number of products**.
2.  The program uses a loop to sum up the prices of the products.
3.  The user selects a **category** (1 for A, 2 for B, 3 for C).
4.  A `switch` statement identifies and prints the category type (High, Medium, or Basic).
5.  Finally, the program calculates the discount on the total amount based on the selected category.

## 🚀 Learning Journey
This project represents a **learning milestone**. 
The code successfully compiles with correct syntax and structure. I am currently using this repository to document my progress as I refine the logic to handle more complex scenarios.
